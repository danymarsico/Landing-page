# Landing-page Project

In this first big project I have been able to put to test my knowledge in HTML and CSS, in particular what it concerns layouts and how to properly build a landing page starting from scratch using only an image as reference.
I was able to use different HTML tags like the "div", "p", "a" tags and use flexbox properties to adjust the whole page layout.
